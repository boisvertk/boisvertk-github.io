                <h1> Kala Boisvert</h1>
                <h2>Hairstylist</h2>
                      <p class="info">
                        Kala has been doing hair in NYC since 2012. She attended <a href="https://www.penrose.edu/">Penrose Academy</a> in Scottsdale, AZ, where she had exceptional training including advanced classes in cutting and color. While moving around out west, she worked in Denver and Portland Oregon where she went through advanced Aveda, Bumble and Bumble training, as well as a barbering bootcamp through Rudy's Barbershop. With Rudy's, Kala moved to NYC and worked until she found her current salon, Badlands.</p>
                      <p class="info">
                        As a woman with short hair, Kala felt a lot of disconnect in a lot of salons and barbershops. In an effort to fill that void, she set out with the intention to change the experince of people wanting to express themselves outside conventional beauty standards and gender roles in salons.<br>
                        With a thorough consultation, and Kala's laid back yet meticulous working style, she can help you express yourself with your hair the way that you've always wanted & make you feel comfortable and heard.
